Herding Robots
_____________________

You thought herding cats was hard? (Has anyone actually tried this?)

Well, let's try herding robots. Should be easy, right? Just tell them where to go. They are your forever obedient robot servants.

The catch: you cannot give a command to a single robot. Whenever you give a command, multiple robots will obey. You can tell ALL the blue robots to move forward, or you can tell ALL the '2' robots to rotate left, etc.

The result? A rubix cube-like game of trying to get the robots in order. Even if you are really close, you may be far away, since a small adjustment will make the other robots move as well.

Try it out! Go to https://malachi-holden.github.io/robot-herdingv2/ and play a game or two. See how many moves it takes to match the 'goal' image below.

Have fun!
